# fpga-cookbook

A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer. The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, but this is increasingly rare due to the advent of electronic design automation tools.

All the examples on this repo were tested for a Spartan-3E Board.
