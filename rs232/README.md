# RS-232 Protocol

The purpose of this code is to implement a communication to receive characters via the RS-232 port, where the code of the received character is shown on the discrete LEDs. In our implementation, to standardize the tests, we will use a 115,200 bps rate convention.

This example was tested on a Spartan-3E Board.
