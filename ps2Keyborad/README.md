# PS/2 Keyboard

The purpose of this code is to implement a communication between the kit and a keyboard with the standard PS/2 input. For this, it was necessary to study and understand the bit exchange method used on the PS/2 input. The expected result is to make press a key on any type of standard PS/2 keyboard, or the hex code of the key is on the discrete LEDs.

This example was tested on a Spartan-3E Board.
